# EnergyPricesPrediction

Till the early 20th century, almost all power generation in India were state-run entities, but as the technology and deregulation flourished, more and more private players got a chance to participate in the sector and the energy needs to be increased drastically. Therefore, it is very important to maintain the balance between the cost and profit of both generation and distribution companies in the country. In the open-access electricity market, the terms like Market Clearing Volume (MCV) and Market Clearing Price (MCP) were coined up and it is extremely significant to predict these values to get a fair estimate for the participants.

These are the codes I wrote for my research paper on "Comparison of Energy price predictions using various Machine Learning algorithms" which has been accepted in the ICUE 2020 conference.
