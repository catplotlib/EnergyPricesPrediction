# EnergyPricesPrediction

Till the early 20th century, almost all power generation in India were state-run entities, but as the technology and deregulation flourished, more and more private players got a chance to participate in the sector and the energy needs to be increased drastically. Therefore, it is very important to maintain the balance between the cost and profit of both generation and distribution companies in the country. In the open-access electricity market, the terms like Market Clearing Volume (MCV) and Market Clearing Price (MCP) were coined up and it is extremely significant to predict these values to get a fair estimate for the participants.

In this work, the focus is on exploring the possibilities of predicting the energy price in the open electricity market using four different algorithms namely: Simple Linear Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), K nearest neighbor, and Long Short-Term Memory.

After taking the data from IEX India for 8 days, and running our code on these algorithms, we get the following results:

1. Simple Linear Regression
