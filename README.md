## Energy Prices Prediction using Machine Learning Algorithms

This project focuses on predicting energy prices in the open electricity market using four different algorithms: Simple Linear Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), K nearest neighbor, and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). The work is based on a research paper published at the ICUE 2020 conference.

## Main Focus
- Data handling
- Visualization
- Machine Learning algorithms
- Comparative analysis
- Prediction

## Publication
The research paper, "Comparison of Energy price predictions using various Machine Learning algorithms," has been accepted and published in the ICUE 2020, IEEE Thailand Section International Conference on Utilities and Exhibition. The paper can be found [here](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9307100).
